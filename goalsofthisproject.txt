I came across the following web link in my Linkedin news feed yesterday and was extremely interested in building a data project
around discovering how the topic highlighted in the blog post by ESRI is represented by data from the area of Atlanta, Georgia.

It is going to be a goal of this Github page to build a web interface for data around COVID19 and socio-economic and racial 
demographics.  

I have been active recently in the masks for all, #Masks4all, social media campaign on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, and 
Facebook.  We organized an online art show on Instagram to engage the Atlanta arts scene around wearing masks.  The show was 
hosted on Instagram.

I've been taking an online course from ESRI on Cartography that teaches how to use ArcGIS.  I would like to explore how to 
export a map from ArcGIS to a webpage for hosting as an alternative to Google Maps.  I am impressed by the quality and ease of 
use of the ArcGIS software and seek to use it in mapping data for this project.

First goal: host an ArcGIS map of the Atlanta metro area on the web.
